# Appliance Energy Prediction
Predicted the energy consumed by various appliances using moisture content, temperature and other external conditions given in the data set. We used feature engineering techniques and the **LSTM Network** for training and got the best results. This project was a part of the DataQuest 2020, which was a Kaggle competition organized by PICT ACM Student Chapter. We achieved a **RMSE error of 79.66** and a **R2 score of 0.12** and were ranked **2nd out of 50+ participants** after the final validation
